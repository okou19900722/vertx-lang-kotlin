/**
 * A function providing a DSL for building [SessionOptions] objects.
 *
 *  Options used to create session.
 *
 *
 * <p/>
 * NOTE: This function has been automatically generated from the [SessionOptions original] using
    Vert.x codegen.
 *
 * @param behavior  Set the behavior when a session is invalidated. The release behavior is the
    default if none is specified.
 * @param checks  Set a list of associated health checks. It is highly recommended that, if you
    override this list, you include the default "serfHealth"
 * @param lockDelay  Set the lock-delay period.
 * @param name  Set the human-readable name for the Session
 * @param node  Set the node to which the session will be assigned
 * @param ttl  Set the TTL interval. When TTL interval expires without being renewed, the session
    has expired and an invalidation is triggered. If specified, it must be between <code>10s</code>
    and <code>86400s</code> currently. The contract of a TTL is that it represents a lower bound for
    invalidation; that is, Consul will not expire the session before the TTL is reached, but it is
    allowed to delay the expiration past the TTL. The lowest practical TTL should be used to keep
    the number of managed sessions low. When locks are forcibly expired, such as during a leader
    election, sessions may not be reaped for up to double this TTL, so long TTL values (&gt; 1 hour)
    should be avoided.
